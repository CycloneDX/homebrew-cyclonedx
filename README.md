## Updating

### For consumers

You found an outdated formula? Please let us know - open a github issue and request a bump:  
<https://github.com/CycloneDX/homebrew-cyclonedx/issues/new>

### For maintainers

Formula updating is semi-automated.  
Trigger it by dispatching the [github action "Update a formula"](https://github.com/CycloneDX/homebrew-cyclonedx/actions/workflows/update-formula.yml); this should result in a pull-request with the needed updates.  
The PR is opened as bot, not as the dispatcher, so that the dispatcher/maintainer can review/approve/merge the PR as they like.
